### Git basics
First, you need to clone the repository (aka `repo`):

From wherever you like on your disk, somewhere you will remember
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OlivierLD/LFSF.git
```
This will create a `LFSF` folder reflecting the content of the repo as it is on github.
By default, the branch is `master`. To see it:
```
$ cd LFSF
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
$
``` 

### Usefull git commands (to begin with)
```
$ git status
$ git pull origin master
$ git fetch
$ git log
```

There is also a legally free book about git that can be downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
